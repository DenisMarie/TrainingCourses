# Training courses
Training courses taught in the framework of the project "Innovative Statistical modelling for a better Understanding of Longitudinal multivariate responses in relation to Omic datasets" (ISULO) funded from the European Commission under grant agreement No 840383. 

For each training course, R code are provided to reproduce the analyses. 

The first training course introduces Gaussian graphical model and the R package \texttt{BDgraph}. Applications on simulated and real datasets are performed. 

The second training course introduces the R package \texttt{BayesSUR} for implementing multivariate models. Application on a subset of data provided by Ressom Lab is performed.

The third training course presents the statistical approach developed during the first part of the ISULO project (see https://github.com/DenisMarie/HS-GMRF). Applications on simulated and real datasets are performed.

The fourth training course introduces Bayesian variable selection approaches and presents the statistical approach finished during the first part of the ISULO project (see https://github.com/Heuclin/VCGSS). Applications on real data are performed.
